# May 24th: Started the PCB!

Today I started working on the PCB and choosing components to add.  
I decided to choose some requirements before starting such as the key components.

I decided on using:

- **Main Board:** Xiao ESP32-S3 x3 (2 for testing and prototyping, 1 for main board)  
- **Audio DAC:** MAX98357A or PCM5102A  
- **3.5mm Jack:** PJ-320D  
- **MicroSD:** Generic TF card reader  
- **Display:** ST7789  
- **I/O Expander:** MCP23017  
- **Switches:** 16x Cherry MX  
- **Main Potentiometer**  
- **Volume Potentiometer**  
- **Rotary Encoder**  
- **Voltage Regulator:** AMS1117-3.3 or AP2112  
- **Misc Capacitors**  
- **Misc Resistors**  
- **Xiao Socket Headers** to plug Xiao into PCB  
- **Power Switch**  
- **Battery Charging Circuit:** Should be portable OR able to be used plugged in (3.7V LiPo + TP4056 Module)  
- **DC Barrel Jack:** Additional power charging option

# May 24th: Finished Placing Components onto the Schematic and started wiring!

Today I almost finalised the components that I am going to use and imported and downloaded all the footprints into the schematic.  
I started a rough wiring diagram of  how to connect the components togtether and finished the power charging circuit.
I still need to work on getting the switches and other small components wired up and it was quite challening to find different symbols and footprints for each of the components as they didnt have it available online.
